# Artificial Intelligence Restriction License (AIR License)

Welcome to the repository for the **Artificial Intelligence Restriction License (AIR License)**!

This license was created to provide a way for developers to release open-source software while restricting its use in artificial intelligence (AI) development, training, and similar applications, unless explicit consent is granted by the copyright holder.

## Purpose of the AIR License

As AI technologies continue to evolve, the potential for using open-source software in AI development, training data creation, or enhancing machine learning models has raised concerns. These concerns may include issues related to data privacy, ethics, and unintended consequences of AI-driven decisions.

The **Artificial Intelligence Restriction License (AIR License)** is designed to give creators the freedom to release their software to the open-source community, while ensuring that the software is **not** used in ways that could impact society negatively or in ways the original author doesn't approve of. 

### Key Features of the AIR License

1. **Restriction on AI Use**  
   The AIR License specifically prohibits using the software for the development, training, testing, or improvement of AI systems, machine learning models, or similar technologies without obtaining explicit, prior written consent from the copyright holder.

2. **Free Use in Other Contexts**  
   Apart from AI-related uses, the license allows full freedom to use, modify, distribute, and sublicense the software. This ensures that developers can still contribute to and benefit from the software in a wide range of non-AI contexts.

3. **Preserving Ethical Control**  
   By restricting AI-related uses, the AIR License empowers software creators to retain some control over how their work contributes to the rapidly changing AI landscape, preventing potential misuse in AI applications that could harm individuals, communities, or society at large.

4. **Legal Protection for Developers**  
   The license ensures that developers are protected from any legal liability when the software is used inappropriately, especially in the context of AI, where the consequences of errors or unethical uses can be significant.

### How the AIR License Works

Under this license, anyone is free to:

- Use the software in personal or non-AI development projects.
- Modify, merge, and redistribute the software.
- Sell or sublicense the software as long as the AI restrictions are adhered to.

However, if someone wishes to use the software in AI-related contexts (for example, to train an AI model or build an AI system), they must first obtain **express written consent** from the copyright holder.

This consent process ensures that the software creators have full control over how their work is used in AI development, providing a layer of ethical oversight to prevent misuse.

### How to Request Consent for AI Use

If you wish to use software under the AIR License for AI-related purposes, you must contact the copyright holder for approval. When reaching out, please provide detailed information about your intended use of the software, so the copyright holder can evaluate your request.

### Benefits of the AIR License

- **Ethical AI development:** The license ensures that creators have the ability to control how their software is used in AI applications, reducing the risk of harmful or unethical use.
- **Freedom for non-AI uses:** Developers still have full freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software for non-AI purposes, promoting innovation in a wide range of fields.
- **Legal clarity:** By including a clear restriction, the AIR License protects both the software creators and users from potential legal complications in AI development.

### Summary

The **Artificial Intelligence Restriction License (AIR License)** is a new tool for developers who want to ensure their software is not used in AI development, training, or similar areas without express consent. This license helps strike a balance between contributing to the open-source community and protecting against the potential risks of AI technologies.
